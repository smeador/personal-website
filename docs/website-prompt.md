Build a personal website for **Sean Meador**, an engineering leader based in Austin, TX.

## Content to include

- **Home**: Brief intro, who Sean is and what he does, ways to connect (email, LinkedIn, GitHub, Substack, X/Twitter)
- **About**: Long-form biography covering personal background, engineering philosophy, and interests
- **Writing**: A listing of articles and individual article pages with full MDX/markdown content
- **Experience**: Professional timeline (Afresh, Rakuten, Mozign) and education (Stanford University), each with organization details, multiple roles, dates, and descriptions. Also a section for notable achievements/advisory roles/speaking that don't fit the timeline.

## Core requirements

- All pages must be fully functional and responsive across mobile and desktop
- Content (articles, professional history, education) must be data-driven — not hardcoded in markup — so it's easy to add or modify entries
- Performance must be strong: fast load times, no unnecessary JavaScript, images optimized
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, keyboard navigable, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Any animations should be subtle and purposeful — not decorative
- SEO basics: unique page titles/descriptions, Open Graph tags
- Resume PDF downloadable from the site
- All external links open in new tabs

## Design direction

Entirely up to you. Aim for something that feels professional, personal, and clean — not corporate or generic. The site should feel like it belongs to a real person with taste, not a template.

## Experience images

Images prefixed with `experience` in `/public/images/` should be integrated into the experience section. Get creative and playful with how these are used — they're not meant to be stiff or formal.

## Content assets

The existing repository already has the real MDX content files for articles, professional experience, and education — use them as-is. Profile photo and Austin skyline image are in `/public/images/`. Resume is at `/public/resume.pdf`.
