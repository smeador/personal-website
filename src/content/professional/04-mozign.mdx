      Started my career by founding a mobile app consulting company where I
      led software development. We built custom mobile apps and full-stack
      backends from scratch for various clients. Clients included a Euroleague
      basketball team, a popular poker website, and local businesses in the
      Dallas area.


      As my first professional experience, this was an incredible opportunity
      to learn how to build production-grade software, interface with clients,
      and run a 3-engineer team. I also worked hands-on with product
      management and design which has continued throughout my career.
