      Transitioned back into an IC role to roll up my sleeves and do hands-on
      engineering again. I'm one of two Principal Engineers at Afresh
      supporting a 50-person engineering org. I provide technical guidance and
      strategy across various initiatives while also leading deep technical
      projects of my own.


      One such project was leading the migration of our data platform from
      Snowflake to Databricks to reduce our costs and boost developer
      productivity by being on a unified platform. This was an org-wide effort
      and I coordinated responsibilities across all engineering functions.

  - role: "Director of Product Engineering"

      Led and built the Product Engineering function from a team of 1 (myself)
      to 35 people spanning multiple teams and product lines. This was an
      incredible opportunity for me to scale an engineering org at a
      fast-growing startup. Our function owned all of the customer-facing
      products at Afresh, and we interoperated with Data, Analytics, and ML
      functions to incorporate their services into our features.


      I led the org as we expanded our store-level products to include all
      fresh departments, built corporate data management and analytics tools,
      and launched the initial version of our distribution center forecasting
      solution. We improved the scalability and resiliency of our system to
      support tens of thousands of store-departments and a large national
      retailer (Albertsons).


      I am especially proud of the people and culture on Product Eng. I hired
      our first 15+ engineers and brought on a group of incredible engineering
      managers to lead their respective teams. Together we built a team of
      kind, curious, and driven engineers who cared deeply about both customer
      and social impact.

      Joined Afresh as the 2nd employee and a founding engineer. I was drawn
      to the mission of using ML forecasting to tackle an enterprise problem
      with real environmental impact.


      I took the core ordering product from an early prototype to an
      enterprise-ready solution deployed at our first 3 customers. I built our
      initial iPad app, API backend, and product data models that laid the
      foundation for years to come. I worked closely with our customers to
      understand their store operations and to create a product tailored to
      their needs.
