      Managed a 5-person team responsible for all our mobile applications
      across platforms, with a total user base of 2M+ users. I owned the
      team's roadmap and hired 3 new engineers to support our growth.
      Collaborated closely with Product & Design to grow our user base
      through new features and delightful experiences. Our apps powered a
      market research business which grew to 8-figure revenue with several
      Fortune 500 customers.


      Our team was further responsible for modernizing our mobile tech stack.
      I spearheaded re-platforming our legacy Slice app to Swift and Kotlin,
      and migrating the Unroll.Me application to React Native for
      cross-platform support. We also developed a new analytics stack to
      better measure user behavior and increase our conversion rates.
      Towards the end of my tenure, I also led the mobile QA and Customer
      Support functions.


      I'm most proud of my role mentoring several junior engineers who have
      gone on to have incredible careers. I couldn't have asked for a better
      team and the people at Slice were truly outstanding and taught me a lot
      about leadership and integrity.

      Joined e-commerce startup Slice as an early employee to take over all
      iOS development. I developed core features of the iOS application
      including purchase and package tracking, refund management, and spending
      analytics. Slice was regularly featured as a top package tracking app in
      the App Store.


      Slice was acquired by Rakuten in 2014, along with email management
      service Unroll.Me which joined our business. I built the Unroll.Me iOS
      application from scratch which achieved a top-10 overall ranking in the
      App Store and scaled to millions of users.
