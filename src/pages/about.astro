          <p>
            I'm a seasoned engineering leader with over 15 years of experience
            building products, scaling systems, and managing teams. I embrace
            lifelong learning, and my career has taken me from mobile
            development to full-stack and systems engineering as I've followed
            my curiosity.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm entrepreneurial by nature, and in addition to starting my own
            company, I've joined multiple successful startups as an early-stage
            employee. I've developed several products from zero-to-one, and led
            teams from a few people to full departments as these products
            scaled. I thrive in fast-paced environments and overcoming
            organizational and operational challenges to achieve meaningful
            results.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe great engineering starts and ends with great people. I
            strive to create cultures based on trust, ownership, and curiosity,
            where people feel connected and empowered to do their best work.
            I've had the privilege to be part of and lead teams with incredibly
            talented engineers who care about their craft and each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm currently focused on applying AI in enterprise settings, using
            thoughtfully designed interfaces and domain expertise to solve
            real-world business problems. I love the process of diving deep into
            a problem and collaborating with Product and customers to create
            truly useful solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            I grew up in Dallas and then left for California to study CS at
            Stanford. I lived and worked in San Francisco for many years before
            returning back to Texas a few years ago to be closer to family. I
            now live in the great city of Austin with my wife and our son who
            joined us in 2025.
