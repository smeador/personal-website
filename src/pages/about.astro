            Hey there! I'm Sean Meador, an engineering leader based in the heart
            of Austin, Texas.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey in technology started with a simple curiosity about how
            things work. That curiosity evolved into a passion for building
            elegant software solutions and, more importantly, cultivating teams
            that can tackle the most challenging technical problems with
            creativity and precision.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years, I've had the privilege of leading engineering teams
            through transformative projects—from architecting scalable systems
            that serve millions of users to establishing engineering cultures
            that prioritize both innovation and sustainability. I believe that
            the best technology is built by diverse, empowered teams who aren't
            afraid to challenge conventional thinking.
          </p>

          <p>
            What drives me isn't just the code we write or the systems we
            build—it's the impact we create and the people we help along the
            way. Whether I'm mentoring emerging engineers, diving deep into
            system architecture, or exploring the latest developments in our
            field, I'm constantly energized by the opportunity to learn and
            grow.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond the technical realm, I'm fascinated by the intersection of
            technology and human experience. I believe our industry's greatest
            innovations come not from technology alone, but from understanding
            the real problems people face and crafting thoughtful solutions that
            make their lives better.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not knee-deep in code or leading team discussions, you
            might find me exploring Austin's vibrant tech scene, writing about
            engineering leadership and emerging technologies, or simply enjoying
            the Texas sunshine with a good book.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm always eager to connect with fellow technologists, ambitious
            teams, and anyone passionate about building the future. If you're
            working on something interesting or just want to chat about
            technology, leadership, or the ever-evolving landscape of software
            engineering, I'd love to hear from you.
          </p>
